    -   ### Design
        #### Colour Scheme and Site Theme
        -   The site was designed using nuetral (greys) and traditional wedding themed colours (white/ivory) to maintain the professional theme of the site.
        #### Typography
        -   The Playfair Display font was imported from Google Fonts for use throughout the site with sans-serif used as a fallback font. Playfair Display was chosen for it's style as it was in keeping with the design and feel of the site. Noto Serif was used in the form in the 'Contact' page as it is a similar font but with a bolder style.
        #### Imagery
        -   The various images built into the site have been chosed and styled to grab the attention of the user while still remaining subtle enough to provide a good UX.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
